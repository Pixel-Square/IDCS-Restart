# IDCS-Restart — Developer Docs

This docs folder contains an overview and developer-focused guide for the
College ERP project (backend + frontend).

- `architecture.md` — high-level architecture and app responsibilities
- `developer-guide.md` — quick developer guide: models, admin, auth flow, common commands

Read `architecture.md` first for a top-level view, then `developer-guide.md` for hands-on steps.
